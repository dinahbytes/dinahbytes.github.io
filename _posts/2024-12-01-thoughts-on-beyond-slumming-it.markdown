In the December 2024 edition of Interactions magazine, [Beyond ‘Slumming It’](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3696019) explores the performance of imaged-based generative AI and its reception in the global south. The article highlights how image generators like Dall-E often conjure scenes of poverty when prompted to create images of small towns in India and South Africa, describing AI systems as “artificial slum tourists”. Slum tourism began in the 18th century when wealthy individuals popularized visiting impoverished areas to source shocking stories to tell their social circles [^1]. The authors propose that instead of allowing the images and videos captured by slum tourists to train AI, resulting in an overly negative perception that does not accurately capture the full scope of culture and life in these areas, communities in the global south should be the ones to generate the data to provide a more holistic picture. 

While I understand what the authors and researchers are trying to do, ultimately I don’t see how this benefits these communities in any real or tangible way. They don’t own the AI models, so they don’t benefit financially from improving the models. At best, their community is not shown in a negative light, but considering the audience is using AI instead of legitimately connecting with these communities, what is actually gained by changing the perspective of these digital slum tourists? If I search YouTube for videos of life in the global south, most of the top results will show a white person traveling to various cities and talking with locals. These predominantly white and male content creators benefit from this financially as their viewers grow, and meanwhile the subjects of the video that made the content interesting are shortchanged. Will training AI with content created from people in the global south fix this problem? Should we be encouraging better AI models, further contributing to the imbalance of power for members of disadvantaged communities that already exists today? Or instead should we focus on efforts that have a better chance of benefiting those communities directly?

The authors also suggest this community-driven approach to training better models for speech, specifically with respect to languages that lack extensive documentation or resources. Again, who does this help? It seems like a way for people to use AI to conveniently extract what they want from languages without doing the real work of connecting with native speakers. It also has the potential to reduce job prospects for native speakers who can translate and interpret their language for work. 

Ultimately, and unfortunately, it seems like the end game for the researchers is to improve AI, even at the cost of the communities they supposedly set out to help.
